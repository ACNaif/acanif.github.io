						<pre>Words that have similar sounds but different spellings are called homophones.
This challenge requires you to find a set of homophones generated from a string.

Assume string str of length k is given. Remove a character from this string, if the resulting string "sounds" similar to the original string, it can be a homophone. The challenge is to remove as many characters as possible from the original string to maximize the number of homophones.  

Example: String "knew" has 2, "knew", "new".
Example: String "add" has 2, "add", "ad"
Example: String "scent" has 3, "scent", "sent", "cent"
Example: String "Empty" has 4, "Empty", "Mpty", "Mty", "Mt".

A list of homophones [reference] is given here: <a href=https://engdic.org/homophones-words-list-in-english/>https://engdic.org/homophones-words-list-in-english/</a>

Write a program that takes a string s of length k and a dictionary of strings of size n and an integer p. Find all possible homonyms for the string s where the size of the resulting homophones is less than k but equal to or greater than p. The dictionary is a single-dimensional array of strings containing all the words listed in the [reference].
